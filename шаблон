Hi,

I've reviewed the task and understand that you need to replicate the structure of the original site in your Elementor blog post, including replacing titles and uploading screenshots as thumbnails.

I'm comfortable working within Elementor and can handle both content structuring and image editing efficiently. Iâ€™ll make sure the new post mirrors the original layout precisely.

Would you prefer I start with replacing the titles or focus on the visuals first?

Best wishes,
Beksultan
